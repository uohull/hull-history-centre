            <h3>Data</h3>
            <p>
                The local studies library material is catalogued using <%= link_to 'SIRSIDynix Symphony', 'http://www.sirsidynix.com/products/symphony', :title => 'Click to go to the SIRSIDynix Symphony website', :target => '_blank' %> software and the data is then exported as XML using one of their standard report formats.  
            </p>
            <p>
                The archives material is catalogued using <%= link_to "Axiellâ€™s CALM", 'http://www.axiell.co.uk/calm', :title => "Click to go to Axiell's CALM website", :target => '_blank' %> software and each collection is then exported as EAD using a slightly modified version of the <%= link_to 'Archives Hub EAD', 'http://www.archiveshub.ac.uk/', :title => 'Click to go to the Archives Hub EAD website', :target => '_blank' %> export routine.
            </p>
            <p>
                The data is then brought together and merged into a Solr index, this behind the scenes work was undertaken for us by <%= link_to 'Data Curation Experts', 'http://curationexperts.com/', :title => 'Click to go to the Data Curation Experts website' , :target => '_blank' %>
            </p>

            <h3>Display</h3>
            <p>The data is presented through the use of the <%= link_to 'Blacklight', 'http://projectblacklight.org/', :title => 'Click to go to Project Blacklight website', :target => '_blank' %> software, originally developed at the University of Virginia Library, but is now an open source Ruby on Rails gem. It uses <%= link_to 'Apache Solr', 'http://lucene.apache.org/solr/', :title => 'Click to go to the Apache Solr website', :target => '_blank' %> as the basis for its search engine. </p>

            <p>The display templates were based on the work undertaken to use Blacklight for the <%=  link_to 'University of Hull library catalogue', 'http://blacklight.hull.ac.uk/', :title => 'Click to go to the University of Hull Library Catalogue', :target => '_blank' %> and then modified to accommodate History Centre</p>
